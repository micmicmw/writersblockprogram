I want to create the core prompt and the basic UI for this program.

- Find a mascot and a name for this program. Going with a assistant vibe.

COMPLETE- add the ability to save prompts to file to be able to bring up later. - We can load saved files 
  into our prompts page. We still need to make the saving function for the program. SHouldn't be to 
  hard once we start.

- add more themes for characters, starting with superhumans for now because of test group.

- add the feature to remember settings.

- add a feature to tell the time of day for greeting the user

- add the feature to give a intro message and then to greet the user each time after in a non-intro way.

- Fix the resolution problem.- I think i fixed it atleast on my computer check with feedback group for 
				theres.
- Figure out why the input field is not clearing we may need to resort to using the normal input field 
	for this in unity instead of textmesh
